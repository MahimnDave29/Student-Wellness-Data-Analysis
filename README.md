# Student Wellness Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This dashboard visualizes survey data from students to identify patterns and correlations between various wellness indicators and academic habits. 
The analysis provides insights for educational institutions to better support student well-being and optimize learning environments.

## Key Metrics Analyzed

### Wellness Indicators
- **Academic Pressure (AP):** Stress levels related to coursework 
- **Financial Stress (FC):** Economic burden on students 
- **Study Satisfaction (SS):** Contentment with learning experience 

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Sleep Duration:** Categorized sleep patterns across four ranges
- **Study Hours:** Daily study time distribution (0-12 hours)

## Dashboard Visualizations

### Academic Pressure Distribution
Student counts across pressure levels:
- AP Level 5: 13 students (highest pressure)
- AP Level 4: 7 students
- AP Level 3: 9 students
- AP Level 2: 8 students
- AP Level 1: 9 students (lowest pressure)

### Financial Stress Analysis
Distribution showing financial burden impact:
- FS Level 3: 13 students (moderate-high stress)
- FS Level 5: 10 students (highest stress)
- FS Level 1: 10 students (low stress)
- Additional data points for FC Levels 2 and 4

### Study Satisfaction Levels
Student satisfaction with academic experience:
- SS Level 4: 13 students (high satisfaction)
- SS Level 3: 12 students
- Other levels show varied distribution

### Sleep Duration Breakdown
Sleep pattern distribution:
- **5-6 hours:** 11 students
- **7-8 hours:** 12 students (recommended range)
- **Less than 5 hours:** 18 students (concerning)
- **More than 8 hours:** 5 students

### Study Hours Analysis
Daily study time distribution spanning 0-12 hours:
- Peak at 0 hours: 53 students
- Peak at 11 hours: 45 students
- Average distribution across other hours: 29-42 students

## Key Insights

- Significant portion of students (18) sleep less than 5 hours, indicating potential health concerns
- Study hours show bimodal distribution with peaks at extremes
- Financial stress affects substantial student population (Level 3: 13 students)
- Academic pressure varies widely across the student body
- Correlation analysis reveals relationships between stress factors and behavioral patterns
